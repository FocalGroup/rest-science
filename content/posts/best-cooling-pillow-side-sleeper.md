# The Best Cooling Pillow for Side Sleepers

As a sleep coach, I've seen firsthand the struggles of side sleepers trying to get a good night's rest. But it doesn't have to be that way! A cooling pillow can make all the difference in ensuring a comfortable and restful night's sleep.

But not just any cooling pillow will do – we need one that's specifically designed for side sleepers. That's where our top pick comes in.

## The Recommendation

We've found the perfect solution for side sleepers looking to beat the heat while they sleep. Our top recommendation is:

This pillow is designed specifically with side sleepers in mind, and features a unique cooling system that will keep you cool throughout the night.

## Buying Guide

While our recommended pillow stands out from the rest, there are a few other things to consider when shopping for a cooling pillow as a side sleeper. Here are some key factors to look for:

* **Material**: Look for pillows made with breathable materials such as bamboo or phase-change materials.
* **Loft**: Side sleepers tend to prefer higher-loft pillows that can provide the necessary support for their neck and shoulders.
* **Cooling System**: While our recommended pillow has a built-in cooling system, not all pillows do. Consider what type of cooling technology is most important to you (e.g. ventilation, phase-change materials).
* **Price**: Cooling pillows tend to be more expensive than standard pillows, but consider the long-term benefits to your sleep and overall health.

By considering these factors and choosing a pillow that meets your needs, you can say goodbye to hot nights and hello to restful sleep.
