## Buying Guide: What to Look for

While the weighted blanket mentioned above is an exceptional product, there are a few things to consider when selecting a weighted blanket for anxiety.

*   **Weight**: A good weighted blanket should have a weight that's evenly distributed and comfortable. Typically, this means 10-15% of your body weight.
*   **Materials**: Look for high-quality materials that are breathable, soft, and gentle on the skin. Some popular options include cotton, bamboo, and polyester blends.
*   **Cover**: Choose a weighted blanket with a removable cover made from a comfortable, machine-washable material.
*   **Fill**: Opt for a weighted blanket filled with glass or polypropylene beads that are hypoallergenic and won't cause discomfort.

By considering these factors and selecting the right weighted blanket, you can say goodbye to anxiety-induced insomnia and hello to a restful night's sleep.
