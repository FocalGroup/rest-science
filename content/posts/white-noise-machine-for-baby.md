## Buying Guide

When shopping for a white noise machine for your baby, there are several factors to consider:

* **Sound options**: Look for a machine with multiple sound options, such as ocean waves, rain, and fan sounds.
* **Volume control**: Ensure the machine has a volume control so you can adjust the sound to a comfortable level for your child.
* **Portability**: Consider a machine that is compact and lightweight, making it easy to take on-the-go.
* **Battery life**: If you plan to use the machine while traveling or in a room without power outlets, look for one with a long battery life.

By considering these factors and investing in a high-quality white noise machine like the one mentioned above, you can create a sleep-friendly environment that will help your baby (and you!) get the restful sleep you both deserve.
